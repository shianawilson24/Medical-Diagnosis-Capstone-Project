# Medical-Diagnosis-Capstone-Project
Finding ways to reduce the medical diagnosis rate between COVID and Pneumonia has been an ongoing issue in recent years. Failure in identifying diseases has led to extremely harmful results and inaccurate treatments. Solving this detrimental issue will drastically reduce the medical diagnosis rate. This solution will allow effective and efficient treatment without a patient facing unfortunate dilemmas due to incorrect diagnosis and treatments. A proposal to aid in this solution is to utilize a machine learning model that will analyze large quantities of medical data, specifically chest X-Rays that include COVID, Pneumonia, and normal cases, in order to correctly identify patterns associated with these lung diseases. Using a machine learning algorithm, Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we can process the given X-rays and allow our model to make crucial predictions in identifying various lung diseases.
